**Definition 1.5.5.** A set is *countable* if $\mathbb{N} \sim A$. An infinite set that is not countable is called an *uncountable* set.

**Theorem 1.5.6 (ii)** *The set $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.*

**Proof:**

**Exercise 1.5.1** If $A \subseteq B$ and $B$ is countable, then $A$ is either countable or finite.

Assume $B$ is a countable set. Thus, there exists $f : \mathbb{N} \to B$, which is $1-1$ and onto. Let $A \subseteq B$ be an infinite subset of $B$. We must show that $A$ is countable.

Let $n_1 = \min\{ n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) \in A\}$. As a start to a definition of $g : \mathbb{N} \to A$, set $g(1) = f(n_1)$. Show how to inductively continue this process to produce a $1-1$ function $g$ from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $A$.

**Proof:** Set $n_1 = \min\{ n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) \in A\}$ and,
$$n_k = \min\{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n > n_{k-1} \, \text{and} \, f(n) \in A\},\quad \text{for} \, k \geq 2.$$
then define, $g(k) = f(n_k)$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Assume, $g(k_1) = g(k_2)$. Then $f(n_{k_1}) = f(n_{k_2})$. Because $f$ is one-to-one, $n_{k_1} = n_{k_2}$. The sequence $(n_k)$ is strictly increasing, hence $k_1 = k_2$. Therefore $g$ is injective.

Take any $a \in A$. Because  $f$ is onto $B$, there exists some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f(m) = a$. Since $a \in A$, the index $m$ belongs to the set $S = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) \in A \}$.

Now the numbers $n_1, n_2, n_3, \dots$ are precisely the elements of $S$ listed in increasing order. Therefore $m = n_k$ for some $k$ (namely, $k$ is the number of elements of $S$ that are $\leq m$). Consequently, $g(k) = f(n_k) = f(m) = a$. Hence every $a \in A$ is in image of $g$, so $g$ is onto.

**Exercise 1.5.3 (i)** If $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m$ are each countable sets, then the union $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_m$ is countable.

**(ii)** If $A_n$ is a countable set for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} A_n$ is countable.

**Proof: (i)** Let's do sanity check for $m = 2$, then we have sets $A_1$ and $A_2$. Replace set $A_2$ by $B_2 = A_2 \setminus A_1$ and notice that $A_1 \cup B_2 = A_1 \cup A_2$.

Since both sets $A_1$ and $B_2$ are countable that means there exist two bijective functions $f$ and $g$ one for each. Say, $f: \mathbb{N} \to A_1$ and $g: \mathbb{N} \to B_2$ and define another function $h : \mathbb{N} \to A_1 \cup B_2$ as,

$$h(2k - 1) = f(k), \quad h(2k) = g(k), \quad \text{for} \, k \geq 1.$$

To prove injectivity of $h$, assume there are two natural numbers $k_1$ and $k_2$ with $h(k_1) = h(k_2)$.

**Case 1:** Both $k_1$ and $k_2$ have are odd.
Then from $h(k_1) = h(k_2)$, we see that $f((k_1 + 1) / 2) = f((k_2 + 1) / 2)$. Since $f$ is injective that implies,
$(k_1 + 1) / 2 = (k_2 + 1) / 2$. Thus, $k_1 = k_2$.

**Case 2:** Both $k_1$ and $k_2$ have different parity.
WLOG assume that $k_1$ is odd and $k_2$ is even. Then from $h(k_1) = h(k_2)$, we get, $f((k_1 + 1) / 2) = g(k_2 / 2)$. But this is impossible because $A_1 \cup B_2 = \emptyset$.

To prove surjectivity of $h$, pick any $y \in A_1 \cup B_2$ then either $y \in A_1$ or $y \in B_2$.

**Case 1:**  $y \in A_1$. Surjectivity of $f$ implies that there exists some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f(k) = y$. Further we know, for any $k \geq 1$, $f(k) = h(2k - 1)$.

**Case 2:** $y \in B_2$. Surjectivity of $g$ implies that there exists some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $g(k) = y$. Further we know, for any $k \geq 1$, $g(k) = h(2k)$.

Thus, $h$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $A_1 \cup B_2$.

If $B_2$ were finite of size $n$ with elements $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ then we can define, $h$ as $h(k) = b_k$ for $k \leq n$ and $h(k) = f(k - n)$ for all $k \geq n + 1$.

Say, the theorem's statement holds for all countable sets $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n$ where $n \leq m$.
Suppose we have $m+1$ countable sets $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_m, A_{m + 1}$ and consider,

$$
\bigcup_{n = 1}^{m + 1} A_n = \left( \bigcup_{n = 1}^{m } A_n \right) \bigcup A_{m + 1}
$$

From inductive hypothesis, $\bigcup_{n = 1}^{m} A_n$ is countable, call it $T$ then,

$$\bigcup_{n = 1}^{m + 1} A_n = T \, \bigcup A_{m + 1}.$$
From above we know that union of two countable sets is countable. Hence, theorem holds for all natural number $m$.
