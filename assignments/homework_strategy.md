# A Strategy for Attacking Problems (and Knowing When to Quit)

Here is a structured approach to use for every non-trivial problem, especially homework problems.

**Stage 1: The Deep Dive (Attempt 1 - At least 30-45 minutes of focused work)**

1. **Restate the problem in your own words.** What are you being asked to prove? What are the givens?
    
2. **Write down all relevant definitions.** If the problem mentions a "limit," write the $\epsilon$-$N$ definition. If it mentions "compact," write the open cover definition. This is non-negotiable. 90% of analysis proofs start by "unpacking the definitions."
    
3. **Gather known theorems.** What lemmas or earlier results might be relevant?
    
4. **Explore.**
    
    - Try to draw a picture or think of a concrete example. If the statement is about a general function $f$, try it with $f(x)=x^2$.
        
    - Can you prove a simpler version? If it's about a sequence, can you prove it for a monotone sequence first?
        
    - If it's an "if and only if" statement, try proving one direction.
        
    - Try to work backwards. What would the last line of the proof be? What do you need to show to get there?
        

**Stage 2: The Strategic Break (Attempt 2 - After a few hours or the next day)**

1. After your deep dive, step away. Go to another class, eat a meal, sleep on it.
    
2. Come back with fresh eyes. Read your scratch work. Sometimes the solution will appear now that your brain has been subconsciously working on it. This "aha!" moment is incredibly valuable and builds deep neural pathways.
    

**Stage 3: The "Solution Inspection" (If still stuck - This answers your main question)**

If you are still completely stuck after two dedicated attempts, it's time to look at a solution. **But you must do it strategically.**

- **DO NOT** just copy the solution into your notes. This is the trap you've already identified.
    
- **DO** use the solution as a **hint system**.
    
    - Read the first line or two of the solution. What did they do? Did they start by defining $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$? Did they break it into two cases?
        
    - **Stop reading.** Close the book/file. Now, try to finish the problem on your own, armed with this initial idea.
        
    - If you get stuck again, look at the next small step. Repeat this process.
        
- **Analyze the Solution:** Once you've successfully written the proof (with help), treat the solution like a masterclass.
    
    - **Why** did they start that way?
        
    - **How** did they know to choose that particular $\epsilon$ or that particular $N$? (This is the key to analysis!)
        
    - **What** was the key insight that you missed?
        

**The goal is not to have a solution; the goal is to learn the _technique_ so you can use it next time.**
