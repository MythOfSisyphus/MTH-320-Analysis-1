# Consequences of Completeness

**Theorem 1.4.1 (Nested Interval Property)** *For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, assume we are given a closed interval $I_n = [a_n, b_n] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a_n \leq x \leq b_n\}$. Assume also that each $I_n$ contains $I_{n+1}$. Then, the resulting nested sequence of closed intervals $$I_1 \supseteq I2 \supseteq I3 \supseteq I4 \supseteq \cdots$$ has a nonempty intersection; that is, $\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} I_n \ne \emptyset$.*

**Theorem 1.4.2 (Archimedean Property) (i)** Given any number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $n > x$.

**(ii)** Given any real number $y > 0$, there exists an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $1/n < y$.

**Theorem 1.4.3 (Density of  $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$).** For every two real number $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, there exists a rational number $r$ satisfying $a < r < b$.

**Exercise 1.4.2.** Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above, and let $s \in \mathbb{R}$ have the property that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}, s + \frac{1}{n}$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $s - \frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Show $s = \sup{A}$.

**Proof 1:** Since $A$ is nonempty and bounded above subset of $\mathbb{R}$ then by Axiom of Completeness the $\sup{A}$ exists. Moreover, $s + \frac{1}{n}$ is and $s - \frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound for $A$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ that is,

$$s - \frac{1}{n} < \sup{A} \leq s + \frac{1}{n}, \quad \forall \, n \in \mathbb{N}$$

- Assume that $\sup{A} < s$. Then choose $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < s - \sup{A}$. Then $s - \frac{1}{n} > \sup{A}$, contradicting $s - \frac{1}{n} < \sup{A}$. Hence $\sup{A} \geq s$.
- Assume that $\sup{A} > s$. Then choose $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \sup{A} - s$. Then $s + \frac{1}{n} < \sup{A}$, contradicting $\sup{A} \leq s + \frac{1}{n}$. Hence $\sup{A} \leq s$.

Thus $\sup{A} = s$.

**Proof 2:** Since $A$ is nonempty and bounded above, $\sup{A}$ exists, by Axiom of Completeness.

We first show that $s$ is an upper bound for $A$. Suppose for contradiction there exists $a \in A$ such that $a > s$. Let $\delta = a - s$. By the Archimedean Property choose $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \delta$. Then $a - s = \delta > \frac{1}{n} \implies a > s + \frac{1}{n}$, contradicting  that $s + \frac{1}{n}$ is an upper bound for $A$. Hence $a \leq s$ for all $a \in A$, so $s$ is an upper bound for $A$.

Next, let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary real number. Choose $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \epsilon$. Since $s - \frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound $A$, there exists some $a \in A$ such that $a > s - \frac{1}{n} > s - \epsilon$. Thus, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $a \in A$ with $a > s - \epsilon$.

Since $s$ is an upper bound for $A$ and satisfies the condition that for every $\epsilon > 0, s - \epsilon$ is not an upper bound, we conclude that $s = \sup{A}$.

**Exercise 1.4.3.** Prove that $\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} (0, 1/n) = \emptyset$. Notice that this demonstrates that the intervals in the Nested Interval Property must be closed for the conclusion of the theorem to hold.

**Proof:** Suppose for contradiction that $x \in \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} (0, 1/n)$ that is $0 < x < 1/n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By the Archimedean Property there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1/N < x$ that contradicts $x < 1/N$. Therefore, no such $x$ exists. Hence, $\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} (0, 1/n) = \emptyset$.

**Exercise 1.4.6** Recall that a set $B$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ if an element of $B$ can be found between any two real numbers $a < b$. Which of the following sets are dense in $\mathbb{R}$? Take $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N}$ in every case.

$\quad (a)$ The set of all rational numbers $p/q$ with $q \leq 10$.
$\quad (b)$ The set of all rational numbers $p/q$ with $q$ a power of $2$.
$\quad (c)$ The set of all rational numbers $p/q$ with $10|p| \geq q$.

**Solution:** $(a)$ is not dense in $\mathbb{R}$. We can verify this by taking $a = 1/12$ and $b = 1/11$ and notice that there doesn't exist any rational number $p/q$ in $(a, b)$ with $q \leq 10$.

$(a)$ Define, $$A = \left \{ \frac{p}{q} : p \in \mathbb{Z}, \, q \in \mathbb{N}, \, q \leq 10 \right \}.$$

**Claim:** $A$ is not dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Proof:** Take $a = 1/12$ and $b = 1/11$. Because every number in $(a, b)$ is positive and less than $0.1$. For any positive rational $p/q$ with $q \leq 10$ we have $p/q \geq 1/q \geq 1/10 = 0.1$; hence no such rational can belong to $(a, b)$. Thus the set fails to be dense.

$(b)$ Define $B = \{ p / 2^{k} : p \in \mathbb{Z} \, \text{and} \, k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. Following along the lines of reasoning of proof of the **Theorem 1.4.3**, we see that $B$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Proof:** We prove the existence of a rational number in $B$ for any given reals $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$.

Choose any $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that,

$$\frac{1}{2^{k}} < b - a \tag{1}$$

and consider rational numbers such as $0, 1/2^k, 2/2^k, 3/2^k, \dots$ then at least one of them must lies in the interval $(a, b)$ as length of the interval is greater than distance between any two consecutive rational numbers of the mentioned form.

Moreover, for some $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, we want, $$a < \frac{p}{2^k} < b \iff 2^k a < p < 2^k b$$

Say, $p$ is least integer greater than $2^k a$ then,

$$p - 1 \leq 2^k a < p$$

and

$$\begin{aligned}
p &\leq 2^k a + 1 \\
&< 2^k \left( b - \frac{1}{2^k} \right) +  1 && \text{from (1)} \\
&= 2^k b
\end{aligned}$$

This completes the proof that, $a < p/2^k < b$. Therefore, $B$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

$(c)$ Define, $$C = \left \{ \frac{p}{q} : p \in \mathbb{Z}, \, q \in \mathbb{N}, \, 10 |p| \geq q \right\}$$

**Claim:** $C$ is not dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Proof:** For any $r = p/q \in C$ we have $10 |p| \geq q \implies |p| / q \geq 1/10 \implies |r| \geq 1/10.$ Hence every positive number in $C$ is at least $0.1$.

Choose the interval $(0, 0.05)$. Because all its elements are positive and $< 0.1$, it cannot contain any element of $C$. Therefore $C$ fails to be dense.
