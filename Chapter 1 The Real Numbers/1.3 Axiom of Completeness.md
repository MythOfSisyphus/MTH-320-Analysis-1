**Exercise 1.3.1.** $(a)$ Write a formal definition in the style of Definition 1.3.2 for the *infimum* or *greatest lower bound* of a set.

$(b)$ Now, state and prove a version of Lemma 1.3.8 for greatest lower bounds.

**Solution:** $(a)$ Definition for the *infimum* of a set:

**Exercise 1.3.9.** $(a)$ If $\sup{A} < \sup{B}$, show that there exists an element $b \in B$ that is an upper bound for $A$.

$(b)$ Give an example to show that this is not always the case if we only assume $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

**Exercise 1.3.10 (Cut Property).** The *Cut Property* of the real numbers is the following:

> If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, disjoint sets with $A \cup B = \mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then there exists $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \leq c$ whenever $x \in A$ and $x \geq c$ whenever $x \in B$.

$(a)$ Use the Axiom of Completeness to prove the Cut Property.

$(b)$ Show that the implication goes the other way; that is, assume $\mathbb{R}$ possesses the Cut Property and let $E$ be a nonempty set that is bounded above. Prove $\sup{E}$ exists. 

$(c)$ The punchline of parts $(a)$ and $(b)$ is that the Cut Property could be used in place of the Axiom of Completeness as the fundamental axiom that distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers. To drive this point home, give a concrete example showing that the Cut Property is not a valid statement when $\mathbb{R}$ is replaced by $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Exercise 1.3.11.** Decide if the following statements about suprema and infima are true or false. Give a short proof for those that are true. For any that are false, supply an example where the claim in question does not appear to hold. 

$(a)$ If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, bounded, and satisfy $A \subseteq B$, then $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

$(b)$ If $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$ for sets $A$ and $B$, then there exists a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $a < c < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$(c)$ If there exists a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $a < c < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$.

**Proof:** $(a)$ Since $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is in $B$. Because $B$ is bounded above, $\sup{B}$ exists (by Axiom of Completeness) and satisfied $x \leq \sup{B}$ for all $x \in B$. In particular, for each $a \in A$, we have
$a \leq \sup{B}$. Thus $\sup{B}$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $\sup{A}$ is the least upper bound for $A$, it follows that $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

$(b)$ Assume $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$. By the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a real number $c$ such that $\sup{A} < c < \inf{B}$ (for instance, $c = \frac{\sup{A} + \inf{B}}{2})$. Now, for any $a \in A$, we have $a \leq \sup{A} < c,$ so $a < c$. For any $b \in B$, we have $c < \inf{B} \leq b$, so $c < b$. Thus $a < c < b$ holds for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$(c)$ Let $A = (1, 2)$ and $B = (2, 3)$. Take $c = 2$. Then for every $a \in A$ we have $a < 2$, and for every $b \in B$ we have $2 < b$, so $a < c < b$ holds for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. However, $\sup{A} = 2$ and $\inf{B} = 2$, so $\sup{A} \not < \inf{B}$.
